# ⚽ EduSub – Teacher Substitute Management System

> 🚧 Replace the screenshot with one that shows your main screen.

![UI Showcase](docs/ui-images/ui_showcase.png)

EduSub is a browser-based application developed for the course Advanced Programming (BSc BIT, FHNW).

The system supports school management in coordinating teacher substitute assignments in case of absence.
---

This project is intended to:

- Practice the complete process from **application requirements analysis to implementation**
- Apply advanced **Python** concepts in a browser-based application (NiceGUI)
- Demonstrate **data validation**, a clean architecture (presentation / application logic / persistence), and **database access via ORM**
- Produce clean, well-structured, and documented code (incl. tests)
- Prepare students for **teamwork and professional documentation**
- Use this repository as a starting point by importing it into your own GitHub account  
- Work only within your own copy — do not push to the original template  
- Commit regularly to track your progress

## 📝 Application Requirements

---

### Problem
In schools, when a teacher becomes ill or unavailable, the school management must quickly find a substitute teacher.
This process is often handled via phone calls, emails, or spreadsheets, which leads to delays, confusion, and lack of transparency.
EduSub solves this coordination problem by providing a centralized web platform for managing substitute requests.

---

### Scenario

When a teacher is absent:
1.	The school management creates a substitute request in the system.
2.	Available substitute teachers can view open requests.
3.	A substitute teacher can accept a request.
4.	The system updates the status and records the assignment in the database.

The platform ensures transparency, prevents double bookings, and maintains historical records.

---

### User stories

1.	As a school manager, I want to create a substitute request so that I can quickly find a replacement teacher.
2.	As a substitute teacher, I want to see all open substitute requests so that I can choose suitable assignments.
3.	As a substitute teacher, I want to accept a request so that the school knows I will take the assignment.
4.	As a school manager, I want to see who accepted a request so that planning is reliable.
5.	As an admin, I want to manage users and roles so that only authorized users access the system.
6.	As the system, I want to prevent double bookings so that a substitute cannot accept overlapping assignments.

### Use cases

> 🚧 Name actors and briefly describe each use case. Ideally, a UML use case diagram specifies use cases and relationships.

![UML Use Case Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/uml_use_case_diagram.png)

**Use cases**
- Show Menu (Customer)
- Create Order / Add Items (Customer)
- Show Current Order and Total (Customer)
- Checkout & Print Invoice (Staff) → generates `invoice_xxx.pdf`
- View Past Transactions (Admin)

**Actors**
- Customer (places orders)
- Staff (processes/prints invoices)
- Admin (reviews transactions)

---

### Wireframes / Mockups

> 🚧 Add screenshots of the wireframe mockups you chose to implement.

![Wireframe – Home](docs/ui-images/wireframe_home.png)
![Wireframe – Checkout](docs/ui-images/wireframe_checkout.png)

---

## 🏛️ Architecture

> 🚧 Document the architecture components, relationships, and key design decisions.

### Software Architecture

> 🚧 Insert your UML class diagram(s). Split into multiple diagrams if needed.

![UML Class Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/uml_class_architecture.png)

**Layers / components:**
- UI (NiceGUI pages/components, browser as thin client)
- Application logic (controllers + domain/services)
- Persistence (SQLite + ORM entities + repositories/queries)

**Design decisions (examples):**
- Organize code using **MVC**:
   - **Model:** domain + ORM entities (e.g. `models.py`)
   - **View:** NiceGUI UI components/pages
   - **Controller:** event handlers and coordination logic between UI, services, and persistence
- Separate UI (`app/main.py`) from domain logic (e.g. `pricing.py`) and persistence (e.g. `models.py`, `db.py`)
- Use and interaction of modules to minimize dependencies, by minimizing cohesion and maximizing coupling
- Keep business rules testable without starting the UI

**Design patterns used (examples):**
- MVC (Model–View–Controller)
- Repository/DAO for database access (e.g. `queries.py`)
- Strategy for business rules (e.g. discount calculation)
- Adapter for external services (e.g. invoice generation backend)

---

### 🗄️ Database and ORM

> 🚧 Describe the database and your ORM entities. Ideally, a diagram documents the database and it is described together with the ORM entities.

![ER Diagram](docs/architecture-diagrams/er_diagram.png)

**ORM and Entities (example):** In the database, order are stored in ... that are mapped an `Order` entity. The `Order` ↔ `OrderItem` relationship ... ensures that an `Order` has at least one `OrderItem` and an `OrderItem` always relates to an `Order`.

---

## ✅ Project Requirements

---

> 🚧 Requirements act as a contract: implement and demonstrate each point below.

Each app must meet the following criteria in order to be accepted (see also the official project guidelines PDF on Moodle):

1. Using NiceGUI for building an interactive web app
2. Data validation in the app
3. Using an ORM for database management

---

### 1. Browser-based App (NiceGUI)

> 🚧 In this section, document how your project fulfills each criterion.

The application interacts with the user via the browser. Users can:

- View the pizza menu
- Select pizzas and quantities
- See the running total
- Receive an invoice generated as a file

**Architecture note (per SS26 guidelines):** the browser is a thin client; UI state + business logic live on the server-side NiceGUI app.

---

### 2. Data Validation

The application validates all user input to ensure data integrity and a smooth user experience.
These checks prevent crashes and guide the user to provide correct input, matching the validation requirements described in the project guidelines.

---

### 3. Database Management

All relevant data is managed via an ORM (e.g. SQLModel or SQLAlchemy). For the pizza example this includes users, pizzas, and orders.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation

---

### Technology

- Python 3.x
- Environment: GitHub Codespaces
- External libraries (e.g. NiceGUI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic)
